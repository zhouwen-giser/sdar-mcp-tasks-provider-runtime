# H5 Test Results

Executed on 2026-07-17 against the repository test stack and an isolated PostgreSQL 17
container. No test was skipped. Remote workflow ids will be added only after actual runs finish.

## Environment failures retained as evidence

The first database invocation used `127.0.0.1:5432`, which was a different local PostgreSQL
instance and rejected authentication. It was rerun against the isolated container's actual
published port `57611`, where all 44 tests passed. The first aggregate `pnpm verify` stopped at
the locally installed Windows `protoc.exe`, which exits `0xC0000135` because the published binary
imports debug Visual C++ runtime DLLs. A standalone Windows SBOM check also could not resolve
`pnpm.cmd`. These are not counted as passing runs. Build, conformance and capacity then passed in
Linux; the branch/PR Linux workflow remains the required aggregate `pnpm verify` evidence.
