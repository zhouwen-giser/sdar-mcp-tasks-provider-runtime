# H3 Upstream Sync Evidence

H3 started after commit `1b01891e998d73b5209c5becfdaf013116c3db52` merged the then-current
`origin/main` into the target branch. A pre-commit `git fetch origin --tags --prune` found:

- `origin/main`: `1233fe4ab11995bbce374cfca4fef618668e95ce`;
- `origin/feature/mcp-tasks-provider-runtime-v1`:
  `f0fe46fef63db589606bb5e89d6f6bd4fba92472`;
- local Head versus main: 5 ahead / 0 behind;
- local Head versus target remote: 2 ahead / 0 behind.

There was no new upstream commit or real conflict to merge. The annotated rc.1 tag object
remained `9a4715e6316a23f399ee06eea2444b0245fa1adb` and peeled to
`51d68926ba1bc9e935438e750582693aea3ecf4d` locally and remotely.

After implementation commit `f3ad038` and its normal push, the phase-end fetch found the local
Head and target remote identical; local was 6 ahead / 0 behind `origin/main`. No phase-end merge
was necessary. The push and all current PR #3 workflows succeeded without force or tag
mutation.
