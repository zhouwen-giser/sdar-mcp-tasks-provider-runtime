# H4 Test Results

Executed on 2026-07-17 against the repository test stack and isolated PostgreSQL. No test was
skipped. Local final gate results and remote workflow ids are filled only from actual command
output; this file is updated by the closure commit after CI.

## Required matrix evidence

| Test  | Evidence                                                                            | Result |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| T-017 | removed v2 operation; v1 admission recovery and scheduler use persisted snapshot    | PASS   |
| T-018 | old input uses v1 schema/capability; new call uses changed v2 schema                | PASS   |
| T-019 | Start task-id mismatch rejected before provider binding; admission uncertain        | PASS   |
| T-020 | Get mismatch leaves the entire Task row unchanged and appends an audit Outbox event | PASS   |
| T-021 | incorrect command/Ack sequence remains in durable retry state                       | PASS   |
| T-022 | Reconcile hash/context mismatch leaves Task unchanged; audited identity conflict    | PASS   |

The first aggregate invocation stopped before integration because its shell did not export
`TEST_DATABASE_URL`; the isolated PostgreSQL container was healthy, the variable was set, and
all database suites then ran. A later standalone E2E invocation made the same shell-scoping
mistake and was rerun with the required variable. These pre-test environment exits are retained
here and are not counted as passing test runs. The first lint pass after strengthening T-022 also
found one unsafe spread from an unknown generated Snapshot and one unsafe nested test matcher;
both were corrected before the clean final lint/type/test runs.
