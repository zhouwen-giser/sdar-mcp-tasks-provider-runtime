## A. Main

| Branch                               | Remote head                                                | Classification         | Action                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `main`                               | `d55d64649b7a1cd53197ea393e7af0bb07eabfff`                 | current protected main | migration source                        |
| `feature/sep2663-frozen-protocol-v1` | local branch at `d55d64649b7a1cd53197ea393e7af0bb07eabfff` | Runtime migration      | migrate, then open a Draft PR to `main` |

The migration branch was created directly from the observed remote `main`; no Provider commits are
included.

## B. Active Provider branches

| Branch                                    | Head                                       | PR                                                                              | State                                 | Migration action                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feature/home-assistant-light-provider`   | `f33edb844bbb580fdeb3afc68b840f6a69dfb724` | [#12](https://github.com/zhouwen-giser/sdar-mcp-tasks-provider-runtime/pull/12) | Draft, checks green at inventory time | wait for Runtime migration merge, merge `origin/main`, update the existing PR           |
| `feature/home-assistant-climate-provider` | `8a4721478695fba477c0e1906ba8ae5cfcda7649` | none; local only                                                                | unpublished local Provider work       | preserve; after Runtime migration merge, merge the new `origin/main` before publication |

No other open Provider PR was present. Provider Wire Contract work is intentionally deferred until
the Runtime migration PR has merged.

## C. Mock Adapters

The TypeScript and Python reference Adapters exist on `main`, not on independent active branches.
They migrate with the Runtime branch.

## D. Historical, merged, release, and governance branches

The following remote branches correspond to merged PRs, historical release work, or repository
governance and must not be changed by this migration:

- `agent/docs-external-interface-reference` (merged PR #11)
- `codex` (merged PR #2)
- `feature/mcp-tasks-provider-runtime-v1` (merged PRs #1 and #3-#7)
- `feature/runtime-v1.1-telemetry` (merged PR #9)
- `fix/runtime-v1.1-telemetry-completion` (merged PR #10)
- `release/1.0.0-rc.3` (merged PR #8 and historical release evidence)
- tags `v1.0.0-rc.1` and `v1.0.0-rc.2`

No branch was rebased, force-pushed, deleted, or otherwise rewritten during inventory.

## Contract source finding

The referenced attachment directory contains only `pasted-text-1.txt` (35,884 bytes, SHA-256
`7c27e62e43f0358f3a50718caac4c73001cbc807d5eb2521fced794c81db8ff6`). It is the migration task
package, not the required frozen contract. Neither the latest `origin/main` tree nor the available
attachment corpus contains `SDAR_MCP_Tasks_Unified_Protocol_Profile_V1.0_FROZEN.md` or any file with
the required SHA-256 `d33623f33ea2dfbb0ad56868d9911af6c7b37b354a0b17a76798646bded9a845`.

The frozen document cannot be fabricated or reconstructed from the task summary. H0 contract
vendoring, schema derivation, and conformance implementation remain gated on receiving the exact
source bytes.
