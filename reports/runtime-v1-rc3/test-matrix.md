## Phase regressions

| Phase | Regression                                                               | Result |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| H1    | `lease-expiry-race.test.ts`: two replicas, slow commands, no duplicates  | PASS   |
| H2    | `start-window-race.test.ts`: reconciliation-first bound start watchdog   | PASS   |
| H3    | `stopping-state-regression.test.ts`: no STOPPING regression              | PASS   |
| H4    | `production-config.test.ts`: production fails closed                     | PASS   |
| H5    | `manifest-drift.test.ts`: drift changes readiness                        | PASS   |
| H6    | `outbox-publish-lifecycle.test.ts`: publish/retry/purge lifecycle        | PASS   |
| H7    | `observation-pagination.test.ts`: bounded newest-first pages             | PASS   |
| H8    | `recovery-fairness.test.ts`: failure backoff and new-work fairness       | PASS   |
| H9    | `result-contract-hardening.test.ts`: size, sanitize, schema, MCP mapping | PASS   |

All counts above are real executed tests. In-memory race doubles remain regression tests, while
the capacity gate separately exercised two Runtime instances against real PostgreSQL and a real
gRPC reference Adapter. Adapter conformance remains a reference-Adapter qualification only;
resource-specific production safety is not claimed.
