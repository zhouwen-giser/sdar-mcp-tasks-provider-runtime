R5 implements the P2 timing contract with an injected Clock and persistent anchors: acceptedAt, notBefore, latestStartAt, and nullable deadlineAt. MCP timing metadata is validated for capability agreement, integer bounds, and zoned RFC 3339 scheduling.

Scheduled tools/call creates the admission, Task, revision-zero scheduling observation, outbox event, and optional idempotency outcome before returning. It makes no Adapter call. DurableScheduler performs explicit ticks backed by PostgreSQL `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` claims, starts no earlier than notBefore, allows expired claims to be recovered by another instance, and publishes start-window-missed without an external side effect.

Deadline claims persist STOPPING/cancel intent before RequestCancel. The Ack does not create a terminal state; `tasks/get` requires a later Adapter CANCELLED Snapshot before mapping a deadline-stopped Task to completed/deadline_reached. Runtime drives the same database scheduler with a bounded, non-overlapping polling interval; correctness remains in PostgreSQL state and explicit ticks.
