# Home Assistant Climate Provider Final Delivery Report

Date: 2026-07-19

Branch: `feature/home-assistant-climate-provider`

Base: protected Runtime merge `798656827ea747fb824df2975f8e66135e80fcc2`

## Delivered

- Standalone Node.js Provider for explicitly configured Home Assistant `climate.*` entities.
- Synchronous state reads plus durable power, HVAC-mode, and target-temperature tasks.
- Home Assistant REST service calls and authenticated, reconnecting WebSocket state observation.
- Persist-before-effect task execution, task-ID idempotency, confirmation-based completion,
  monotonic revisions, terminal-state protection, and restart recovery.
- Durable, fail-open telemetry delivery for resource state, temperatures, health, and task progress.
- Secret-file-only token loading, production plaintext-HTTP guard, TLS/mTLS validation, resource
  allowlisting, capability checks, and temperature-range checks.
- Fake Home Assistant fixtures, unit/integration/recovery/security coverage, Runtime/PostgreSQL E2E,
  image integration, Compose example, operator documentation, and an execution plan.
- Frozen request metadata/headers, flat Task results, Ack-first notifications, same-Revision
  `tasks/get` equality, and actual-state type-only Evidence.

The complete repository gate also exercised unit, contract, integration, recovery, security, E2E,
TypeScript/Python conformance, capacity, and repeat-image checks. Generated conformance, capacity,
and image reports are committed with this delivery.

## Verification boundary

Home Assistant behavior was verified against the in-repository Fake Home Assistant and a real local
PostgreSQL-backed frozen Runtime HTTP/SSE path. No physical air conditioner or independently
managed Home Assistant installation was used, so vendor-specific device behavior and a real
deployment remain unverified. The maximum claim is **Home Assistant Climate Provider Component
Conformant**; this report does not claim `real-resource qualified` or `Interop Certified`.

## Publication

The branch is intentionally separate from the light Provider branch. It must be pushed and opened
as its own Draft PR, then pass protected checks before publication is complete.
