# Database Migrations

Migrations are append-only SQL files under `migrations/`, ordered by numeric prefix. Runtime
acquires a PostgreSQL advisory lock, creates `runtime_schema_migration`, verifies the SHA-256
checksum of every applied file, and applies each new file in its own transaction. Checksums use
LF-normalized SQL so Linux and Windows checkouts share one published value; the verifier accepts
the raw checkout hash only when matching a legacy Windows record, and still rejects any content
change. T-047 pins the published 001-006 normalized hashes from rc.1.

`001_operation_snapshot.sql` creates immutable operation snapshots keyed by provider/version/operation/Manifest hash, with UUID primary key, JSON object checks, hash/name checks and lookup index. Reloading the same Manifest is idempotent; a changed Manifest produces a new snapshot instead of rewriting history.

`002_task_lifecycle.sql` creates the durable lifecycle core:

- `admission_intent` is written before StartOperation and records pending, rejected, published, or uncertain admission;
- `provider_task` is the authorization-bound current snapshot with optimistic versioning and irreversible terminal states enforced by repository transactions;
- `task_observation` records monotonic Adapter revisions, while `outbox_event` is committed in the same transaction as visible task state;
- `task_input_request`, `idempotency_record`, and `runtime_lease` reserve durable contracts used by later Profile phases.

The Runtime never returns a task identifier before `provider_task`, its initial observation, the creation outbox event, and the admission publication state commit together. Failed publication leaves only an `UNCERTAIN` admission intent for reconcile; it cannot leak a queryable half-created Task.

`003_idempotency.sql` evolves the reserved idempotency table without rewriting earlier migrations.
It adds pending/complete state, a stable pre-admission taskId, simulation identity, update time, a
pending-recovery index, and a payload consistency constraint. In rc.1 the repository held a
PostgreSQL session advisory lock over final admission. Migration 012 and the H7 repository
replace that connection-held execution window with a durable claim lease while retaining the
stable taskId for Reconcile.

`004_durable_timing.sql` permits a scheduled Task to exist before it has an external execution binding, adds durable not-before and scheduler claim fields, permits revision zero for the Runtime-created scheduling observation, and adds partial due/deadline indexes. Claims are database rows selected with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`; an expired `STARTING` claim is eligible for another Runtime, so restart does not depend on an in-process timer.

`005_task_controls.sql` adds a per-Task command sequence, stable input-request description/required metadata, and the durable command journal for cancel, update, pause, and resume. Command intent and the matching outbox record commit before the Adapter RPC. Deadline workers allocate the same command sequence and journal entries as user cancellation, so the first persisted stop reason wins and a duplicate control request cannot create another Adapter side effect.

`006_recovery_hardening.sql` persists admission timing/TTL anchors needed to recover a response-lost start without a new client call, adds Task recovery attempt/audit fields, and creates partial recovery indexes. Recovery workers take a transaction-scoped PostgreSQL advisory lock per taskId to reconcile uncertain Admissions and nonterminal Tasks; command execution is handled by the Durable Command Dispatcher. Confirmed Adapter `NOT_FOUND` after an external binding becomes an explicit technical failure; transient unavailability leaves the last confirmed Task unchanged.

`007_durable_command_dispatch.sql` upgrades cancellation and mandatory-stop commands to a
recoverable dispatch state machine. It adds claim owner/expiry, attempt count, next-attempt
time, rejection diagnostics, stop priority/reason and the previous Task state needed for an
authoritative user-cancel rollback. Partial indexes enforce one active stop per Task and make
due work claimable by multiple Runtime instances. The migration removes the rc.1 global
request-hash uniqueness rule so a permanently rejected user cancellation can be followed by a
new stable command sequence, while retaining duplicate coalescing for active commands.

`008_start_window_and_schedule_retry.sql` persists the remaining start contract: the time a
safe-stop compensation was requested, the unique invocation attempt, and the next bounded
start-attempt time. It adds partial indexes for immediate watchdog scans, scheduled retries and
expired `STARTING` claims. Existing rc.1 rows retain their confirmed `actual_started_at` value;
scheduled rows start at attempt zero and receive attempt one only when a worker atomically
claims an actual Adapter call.

`009_observation_revision_and_outbox_keys.sql` separates the Runtime-owned monotonic
`observation_revision` from the Adapter Snapshot revision. It expands observations with
message, substate, progress, source and optional Adapter revision, and gives every outbox row a
globally unique stable event key. The rc.1 backfill preserves the highest recorded observation
revision, identifies the Runtime-created scheduled/window/control observations, and treats the
remaining historical Snapshot observations as Adapter-sourced. New lifecycle changes allocate
the next observation revision, update the current Task, append the complete observation and
insert the idempotent outbox event in one transaction.

`010_adapter_execution_identity.sql` enforces provider-scoped uniqueness for every non-null
external execution id. Start and recovery already bind a Task and execution in one publication
transaction; the unique partial index makes a second Task binding fail atomically even if an
Adapter violates its identity contract.

`011_task_handle_retention.sql` turns `ttl_ms` into an executable Task-handle lifecycle. It adds
the renewable handle expiry, terminal time, logical expiry, purge boundary and last Adapter
confirmation time. Existing active finite-TTL Tasks receive a fresh protected window during
upgrade; existing terminal Tasks retain their result for their stored TTL or the 24-hour default.
Partial indexes support batched `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` expiry and purge across Runtime replicas.

`012_idempotency_claim_lease.sql` replaces the connection-scoped advisory-lock execution window
with a durable owner/expiry claim and attempt counter. Existing PENDING rc.1/rc.2 rows receive an
already-due migration recovery lease; COMPLETE rows retain their payload and no lease. The new
partial index orders takeover work by lease expiry. Runtime claims in a short transaction,
performs Adapter work without a checked-out PoolClient, and completes with an owner CAS.

`013_single_claimed_command.sql` is the immutable rc.2 migration that enforces one `CLAIMED`
command per Task.

`014_start_confirmation_watchdog.sql` adds `WAITING_START_CONFIRMATION` and durable confirmation
deadline/attempt fields. Every bound execution without confirmed start is reconciled before a
safe-stop decision, regardless of whether admission was immediate, scheduled or recovered.

`014_observation_pagination.sql` adds the `(task_id, revision DESC)` access path used by bounded
Observation pages. Both 014 files are independent additive changes and are ordered by their full
filenames.

`015_recovery_backoff.sql` adds `next_recovery_at` and `recovery_failure_count`, plus the due-work
index. Successful reconciliation resets the schedule; failures receive bounded exponential
backoff so persistent failures cannot starve newly recoverable Tasks.

`016_command_claim_lease_consistency.sql` requires every claimed command to carry both owner and
expiry. Dispatchers renew ownership during slow Adapter RPCs and use owner-CAS completion,
preventing expired batch claims from producing duplicate side effects across Runtime replicas.

`017_provider_ops_audit_delivery.sql`（Provider 运维审计持久化投递）创建
`provider_ops_delivery`（Provider 运维投递表）。Task、Command 和 Provider Event 的 Audit
Record（审计记录）先以稳定 `event_key`（事件键）和 `record_id`（记录标识）提交到数据库，
再由多副本 Publisher（发布器）通过带过期时间的 claim lease（领取租约）投递。Collector
失败只会进入 `RETRY_WAIT`（等待重试），不会回滚业务事务或阻塞 Product Outbox（产品事件
发件箱）。

`018_runtime_trace_context.sql`（Runtime 链路上下文持久化）为 `admission_intent`（准入意图）
和 `provider_task`（Provider Task）增加 `trace_id`（链路标识）、`root_traceparent`（根级 W3C
父上下文）、`root_tracestate`（根级厂商上下文）和 `correlation_id`（关联标识）。Scheduler、
Command Dispatcher、Watchdog 和 Recovery Worker 可以在进程重启后恢复原 Task Trace（任务
链路），而不需要保存原始请求负载。

`019_runtime_revision.sql` separates the frozen externally visible Task projection clock from
internal persistence maintenance. New and upgraded Tasks start with a positive
`runtime_revision`; `runtime_updated_at` advances atomically with that revision only when the
authoritative `DetailedTask` projection changes. Lease renewals and recovery bookkeeping may
continue to update the internal `updated_at` without changing frozen Wire output.

`020_frozen_protocol_mrtr.sql` stores the exact MCP server-to-client request JSON and the exact
keyed response JSON/hash alongside the retained Legacy input columns. Existing requests are
backfilled as `elicitation/create`; answered Legacy rows are represented as accepted responses.
The Adapter proto adds `McpTaskInputRequest` and `McpTaskInputResponse` on new field numbers while
marking the old `InputRequest` and `UpdateValue` fields deprecated without deleting them.

Runtime startup runs migrations. CI verifies an empty database, repeated startup, duplicate
Snapshot insertion, task lifecycle constraints, crash windows, applied-migration tamper
detection, and a complete 001-006 rc.1 fixture containing pending/uncertain admissions,
working/queued/input/stopping/scheduled/terminal Tasks, a pending command, observation/outbox and
idempotency data. After 007-016 it proves data/backfills and executes Recovery, Dispatcher and
Scheduler in startup order against PostgreSQL 17 and a real gRPC Adapter. v1.1 verifies all
21 migration files through both the rc.1 full-state and rc.2 forward-upgrade paths, including
Provider Ops durable delivery and persisted Trace Context（持久化链路上下文）.

rc.2 repository code reads the committed Task through the same client used for the publication
transaction, then releases it. This is a runtime access-pattern fix and requires no schema
migration; it prevents a one-connection pool from deadlocking after a successful `COMMIT`.
