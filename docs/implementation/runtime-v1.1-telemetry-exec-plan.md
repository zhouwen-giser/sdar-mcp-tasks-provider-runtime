# Runtime v1.1 Provider Ops Telemetry ExecPlan

Status: in progress

Base: verified rc.3 release head `24cd4e2550f4e0c7e3862d1ed871455d66e47327`

Target: `v1.1.0` on `feature/runtime-v1.1-telemetry`

## Scope and invariants

This release adds Provider Ops Telemetry through OpenTelemetry without changing Task lifecycle,
command, scheduling, recovery, safe-stop, Observation, Outbox, readiness, or persistence
semantics. Runtime exports only to OTLP. It does not depend on or connect to ClickHouse or SDAR
Core. Existing Prometheus text output remains supported.

Telemetry is best effort and fail-open relative to business behavior. Export failure, timeout,
queue saturation, serialization failure, and shutdown failure must not fail a Runtime operation
or change readiness. Audit events are derived from committed facts; API handlers must not invent
Task lifecycle events.

Raw arguments, input values, Adapter payloads, authorization material, passwords, tokens, JWTs,
cookies, and secrets are forbidden. Stable hashes and bounded identifiers explicitly listed by
the envelope contract are allowed. Metric attributes must be bounded and must never include
Task IDs, argument hashes, authorization hashes, user IDs, execution IDs, or correlation IDs.

## Design decisions

- `ProviderOpsEnvelope` is the stable product schema. OTel logs are a transport mapping only.
- `recordId` is UUIDv5 over record type plus stable aggregate/event/revision identity.
- `recordHash` is SHA-256 over RFC 8785 canonical JSON excluding delivery metadata such as
  `emittedAt`, exporter retry count, and collector timestamps.
- Task audit events are created from persistence transition results after transaction commit.
  Failed or rolled-back transactions produce no event.
- Trace/event/metric calls are non-throwing at the business boundary and use bounded batch
  processors with explicit timeouts and drop accounting.
- H9 remains optional. If implemented, it stays outside default compose and production images.

This plan is updated as implementation and evidence evolve. A phase is complete only after its
tests pass and its commit is created.
