# Runtime V1.0 Requirement Traceability

This is the maintained implementation matrix. Status values are `planned`,
`in progress`, and `verified`; a row becomes verified only when its complete
named gate has produced real evidence.

| Requirement           | Authority                          | Phase(s)       | Implementation paths                                            | Verification paths / gates                                    | Status                                      |

## R0 evidence

- Specifications and the real repository were read in full.
- No AGENTS/PLANS/CI/code/migration/test assets existed to inherit.
- Empty-project `pnpm test` and `pnpm build` failures are recorded in the
  repository assessment.
- All task-package RQ groups and Definition-of-Done delivery areas now have an
  implementation phase, concrete path, and verification gate.
